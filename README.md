# Simple-Flask-API
This is a simple Image upload API.

Here I have developed a flask api along with a basic 2 page interface, which has the following functionality:
1. Simple interface to upload images and when clicking the "submit" button, it shows a new page with the name of the uploaded image.
2. A key based authentication system using JWT token for accessing the api functionality.
3. Placed a throttle forapicall rate of 5/min.
